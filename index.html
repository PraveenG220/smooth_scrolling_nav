            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Over the past 10+ years as a marketing consultant, expert blogger with Fast Company magazine, 
                and university director, Shawn Graham has worked, interviewed, and partnered with hundreds of CEOs,
                 entrepreneurs, and senior executives.

                From working with companies including Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, and T.
                 Rowe Price to forge new relationships while working at the University of North Carolina, 
                 to watching his grandparents, mother and father, and uncle all launch their own businesses, 
                 to helping clients uncover new ways to market themselves more effectively--each interaction has 
                 provided deep insights into lessons learned and what it takes to successfully grow a customer base 
                 across multiple industries.</p>
                
                <p> Shawn's passion for marketing was permanently etched into his soul after having spent the better
                 part of his childhood watching his family chase their hopes and dreams with every fiber of their 
                 existence. And he calls upon that same passion each and every time he works with clients to help them 
                 grow their businesses.
                
                Graham previously served on the board and marketing committee of Habitat for Humanity of Greater 
                Pittsburgh. Shawn is the author of Courting Your Career.
